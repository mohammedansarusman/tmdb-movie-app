I'm thrilled to showcase my recent project, a movie application clone inspired by platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime. While itâ€™s not an exact replica, Iâ€™ve added my own unique touch to build it from scratch and incorporate personalized features.  
Through this project, I had the opportunity to deepen my knowledge of JavaScript and React.js, honing skills in both fundamental and advanced concepts.  
âœ¨ Key Highlights of the Project:  
âœ… Lazy Loading & Dynamic Bundling: Optimized website performance by reducing load times and improving the user experience.  
âœ… State Management: Leveraged Redux for seamless data handling.  
âœ… Routing: Used React Router DOM for smooth navigation.  
âœ… Custom Hooks: Built reusable hooks to enhance code modularity.  
âœ… React Hooks: Hands-on experience with hooks like useEffect() for lifecycle management.  
âœ… Data Fetching: Integrated the Fetch API for real-time content updates.  
âœ… Shimmer Effect: Added a skeleton loader for enhanced visual feedback during content loading.  
âœ… LazyLoadImage Library: Efficient image loading to further boost performance.  
âœ… React-Icons: For visually appealing UI components.  
âœ… MultiRangeSlider Library: Implemented a dynamic slider for filtering movies by release year.  
âœ… Swiper Library: Built a sleek carousel for showcasing movie providers.  
This journey has been an incredible learning experience, and I'm proud of how far I've come. ðŸš€
